# Terrain Feature Refresh (Not Yet Released)

All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and (if I
remember to auto-sync them), my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

### What it does
This is an open-source redux of Reset Terrain Features (RTF) to allow for "unofficial" updates to be done without breaking any rules.
