# Better Crystalariums

All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and
my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

This mod makes it so that you need to break your crystalarium in order to place a new mineral in it.
