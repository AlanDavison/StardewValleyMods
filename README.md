# DecidedlyHuman's Stardew Valley Mods

Each individual mod will have its own `README.md`, and `LICENSE.txt`.

The only official places to find my mods are here, Nexus Mods, and ModDrop. While my licenses explicitly allow anybody to re-upload my mods, anything not under one of my accounts should be considered third-party.
