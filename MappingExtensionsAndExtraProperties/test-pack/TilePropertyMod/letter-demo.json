It's really a nice little house!^^However, you might need some more space someday. That's where I can help. If you bring me some raw materials and pay a fee, I can expand your house.^(Continued on next page)^^The first expansion I offer includes a kitchen. With a kitchen, you'll be able to cook any recipes you've learned!^^Anyway, I hope you're starting to feel at home in Stardew Valley!^^    Your local carpenter,^        Robin[#]Robin's Services",
