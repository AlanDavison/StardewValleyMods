# Currently tackling


# Done, to be tested
* Allow specifying a sound cue to play for closeup interactions.

# Requires drastic changes
* Letter support!
* Inventory items which open a closeup interaction menu

# Unknown difficulty
* Atravita: maybe out of scope, but what if I could open a MEEP picture at the end of a dialogue pretty please?
* Atravita: If you want to reallllllyyyyyy scope creep give me TAS?
* Animated images.

# Pretty easy

# Slightly tricky
* Support high-res image, and/or image auto-scaling if larger than the screen.
