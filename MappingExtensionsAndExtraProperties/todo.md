# Currently tackling


# Done, to be tested
* Allow specifying a sound cue to play for closeup interactions.
* * Letter support!

# Requires drastic changes
* Inventory items which open a closeup interaction menu

# Oh no
* Special, fancy, animated backgrounds

# Unknown difficulty
* Atravita: maybe out of scope, but what if I could open a MEEP picture at the end of a dialogue pretty please?
* Atravita: If you want to reallllllyyyyyy scope creep give me TAS?
* Animated images.
* Screen reader/general accessibility via Stardew Access (https://github.com/khanshoaib3/stardew-access)

# Pretty easy

# Easy, but lots of refactoring
* MAke a more generic argument parsing system to get rid of needing excessive amounts of TryParse methods.

# Slightly tricky
* Support high-res image, and/or image auto-scaling if larger than the screen.
