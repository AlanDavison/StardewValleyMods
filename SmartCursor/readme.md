Smart Cursor Mod for Stardew Valley
===

All releases can be found on my [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79440738?tab=user+files), and (if I
remember to auto-sync them), my [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/profile/251772/mods) page.

### Summary
Have you played Terraria? Do you wish Stardew had something similar to its smart cursor feature for harvesting resources? Well, now it does!

### What it does
When you hold down the designated key (left control by default) with a tool in hand, it will automatically target a resource it can break within a certain range.

The range depends upon the upgrade level of the tool. So, for instance, an iridium pickaxe has a much larger range than a copper pickaxe.

By default, the mod cannot target giant crops, trees that aren't fully grown, and trees that have tappers on them. These can all be enabled in the settings.

### Settings
#### Keybinds
* Hold to activate smart cursor: *Left control*
#### Toggles
* Allow targeting baby trees: *False*
* Allow targeting tapped trees: *False*
* Allow targeting giant crops: *False*
